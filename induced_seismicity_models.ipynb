We approximate the Arbuckle formation as a 500$\\,$m thick layer of unknown isotropic permeability, $k_a'$, 10% porosity, and matrix compressibility 2$\\times$10$^{-11}$Pa$^{-1}$. The basement has unknown vertical permeability, $k_b'$, and is assigned negligible horizontal permeability, consistent with a conceptual understanding of vertically oriented faults as the primary conduits conducting overpressure to seismogenic depths. The basement is assigned zero compressibility, and 1% porosity.
