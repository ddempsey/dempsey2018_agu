Python library and Jupyter Notebook implementing induced seismicity models presented at 2018 AGU Fall Meeting

## Installation

The Jupyter Notebook in this library provides an executable and interactive interface to selected models from Dempsey and Riffault *\"Response of induced seismicity to injection rate reduction: models of delay, decay, quiescence, recovery and Oklahoma\"* presented at the 2018 AGU Fall Meeting. We provide an abridged explanation of the model, sufficient to introduce the equations and figures. Further discussion and justification of the model assumptions can be found in a forthcoming article.

The models are implemented in Python. The simplest way to get them running is to install the [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution, Version 2.X. To run models using the FEHM reservoir simulator, ensure you have downloaded a copy of [FEHM](https://github.com/lanl/FEHM) and installed [PyFEHM](http://pyfehm.lanl.gov/).
